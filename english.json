["Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law on the establishment of administrative liability for violating the deadline and procedures for payment of goods (works, services) as part of

two years ago, situations in which business owners were unable to collect payment for already-executed state and municipal contracts were widespread.", "At that time, the Russian president tasked the Office of Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation with taking the issue under special control.", "After all, businessmen couldn\u2019t deal on their own with dishonest customers who signed agreements without financial backing, tried their best to get out of assumed payment commitments, and included illegal conditions in agreements.", "The problem was systemic throughout the entire country.", "Since 2015, 9,700 petitions, in the interests of protecting the rights of business owners to receive payment for public contracts, were filed by the Office of the Prosecutor General: according to the results of their investigations, 4,500 officials were subject to disciplinary measures, and 533 were held administratively liable; 75 cases were submitted to the investigative authorities for procedural review, and criminal proceedings were initiated in 46 of them.", "In sum, more than 66 billion rubles worth of debt owed to business owners was repaid.", "Notably, these vast sums were by no means accrued as a result of non-payment of multibillion-ruble contracts.", "Numerous systematic delays in payment for services to business owners for considerably more modest amounts led to these jaw-dropping debts.", "Here is a typical case.", "The head of a small company won a tender for the provision of social transport services worth several million rubles.", "The person invested all of their working capital, fully satisfied their commitments, but didn\u2019t receive the allotted money when it was due.", "The result is an escalating financial snowball comprised of payroll, tax, and loan liabilities, which would have led to bankruptcy if the business owner hadn\u2019t approached the prosecutor\u2019s office for assistance.", "Now, in a number of regions, they have managed to mitigate the problem to the greatest extent possible.", "Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt related to state and municipal contracts, identified by the prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, amounted to approximately 27.4 billion rubles.", "In the regions where debt indicators continue to climb to critical levels, the prosecutor\u2019s office has adopted a hands-on approach to crisis management.", "The prosecutor general is personally holding on-site meetings with local officials, during which they substantively examine all of the violations uncovered by the prosecutors and the measures aimed at their immediate rectification.", "This year, these types of briefing sessions have already taken place in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.", "The realization of Federal Law No. 189-FZ \u201cOn amending the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences in terms of establishing administrative liability for officials of a customer for violating the deadline and procedures for payment of goods (works, services) as part of procurement for state and municipal needs\u201d, which was signed by the Russian president last week, will qualitatively improve the payment discipline of public sector customers.", "The Ministry of Economic Development and Trade of the Russian Federation developed the bill at the request of the Office of the Prosecutor General.", "The new law will add an article to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences, which stipulates a penalty of between 30,000 and 50,000 rubles for violation of the deadline and procedures for payment of goods, works, or services as part of state and municipal procurements by an official of a customer.", "However, if the official has already been subject to administrative punishment for a similar offense, then they will be suspended for a period of between one to two years.", "All the prosecutors for the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already received instructions to enforce the application of these legislative innovations in practice.", "Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri", "The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.", "\"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein,\" the group's statement reads.", "A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.", "\"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.", "They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed,\" the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.", "\"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before.\"", "It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.", "The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.", "Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.", "The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.", "\"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri,\" Chapel said.", "\"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state.\"", "Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.", "The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.", "Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.", "Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.", "Two people have died as a result of a shooting of a

Agency said.", "Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law giving airline companies the right to eliminate the free baggage allowance rule on non-refundable airline tickets.", "The point
